    First things first
    I'ma say all the words inside my head
    I'm fired up and tired of the way that things have been, oh-ooh
    The way that things have been, oh-ooh

    Don't you tell me what you think that I could be
    I'm the one at the sail, I'm the master of my sea, oh-ooh
    The master of my sea, oh-ooh
    I was broken from a young age
    Taking my sulkin' to the masses
    Writing my poems for the few
    That look at me, took to me, shook to me, feelin' me
    Singing from heartache from the pain
    Taking my message from the veins
    Speaking my lesson from the brain
    Seeing the beauty through the...
    Pain! You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
    Pain! You break me down and build me up, believer, believer
    Pain! Oh, let the bullets fly, oh, let them rain
    My life, my love, my drive, it came from...
    Pain! You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
    First things first
    Can you imagine what's about to happen?
    It's Weezy the dragon, I link with the Dragons
    And we gon' get ratchet, no need for imaginin'
    This is what's happenin'
    Second thing second, I reckon immaculate
    Sound about accurate
    I know that strength, it don't come without strategy
    I know that sweet, it don't come without cavities
    I know the passages come with some traffic
    I start from the basement, end up in the attic
    And third thing third
    Whoever count me out, they simply can't count
    Let's get mathematic, I'm up in this, huh
    Is you a believer?
    I get a unicorn out of a zebra
    I wear my uniform like a tuxedo
    This dragon don't hold his breath, don't need a breather
    Love you Miss Cita, the son of a leader
    I know that bloomin' don't come without rain
    I know the losin' don't come without shame
    I know the beauty don't come without, huh
    Hold up, hold up, last thing last
    I know that Tunechi don't come without Wayne
    I know that losin' don't come without game
    I know that beauty don't come without
    Don't come without\u2026
    Pain...
    Pain! You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
    Pain! You break me down and build me up, believer, believer
    Pain! Oh, let the bullets fly, oh, let them rain
    My life, my love, my drive, it came from...
    Pain! You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
    Last things last...
    By the grace of the fire and the flames
    You're the face of the future, the blood in my veins, oh-ooh
    The blood in my veins, oh-ooh
    But they never did, ever lived, ebbin' and flowin'
    Inhibited, limited 'til it broke open and rained down
    It rained down, like...

    Look out for yourself
    I wake up to the sounds of the silence that allows
    For my mind to run around, with my ear up to the ground
    I'm searching to behold the stories that are told
    When my back is to the world that was smiling when I turned
    Tell you you're the greatest
    But once you turn, they hate us
    Oh, the misery
    Everybody wants to be my enemy
    Spare the sympathy
    Everybody wants to be my enemy-y-y-y-y
    (Look out for yourself)
    My enemy-y-y-y-y (Look, look, look, look)
    (Look out for yourself)
    But I'm ready
    Your words up on th\u0435 wall as you're prayin' for my fall
    And the laughter in th\u0435 halls and the names that I've been called
    I stack it in my mind, and I'm waiting for the time
    When I show you what it's like to be words spit in a mic
    Tell you you're the greatest
    But once you turn, they hate us (Huh)
    Oh, the misery
    Everybody wants to be my enemy
    Spare the sympathy
    Everybody wants to be my enemy-y-y-y-y (Look, look, look, look)
    (Look out for yourself)
    My enemy-y-y-y-y (Look, look, look, look; yeah)
    (Look out for yourself)
    Uh, look, okay
    I'm hoping that somebody pray for me
    I'm praying that somebody hope for me
    I'm staying where nobody 'posed to be p-p-posted
    Being a wreck of emotions
    Ready to go whenever, just let me know
    The road is long, so put the pedal into the floor
    The enemy's on my trail, my energy unavailable
    I'ma tell 'em, "Hasta luego"
    They wanna plot on my trot to the top
    I've been outta shape, thinkin' out the box, I'm an astronaut
    I blasted off the planet rock to cause catastrophe
    And it matters more because I had it not
    Had I thought about wreaking havoc
    On an opposition, kinda shockin' they wanted static
    With precision, I'm automatic quarterback
    I ain't talkin' sackin', pack it
    Pack it up, I don't panic, batter-batter up
    Who the baddest? It don't matter 'cause we at ya throat
    Everybody wants to be my enemy
    Spare the sympathy (Ah)
    Everybody wants to be my enemy
    Oh, the misery (Ah)
    Everybody wants to be my enemy
    Spare the sympathy (Ah)
    Everybody wants to be my enemy
    Pray it away, I swear I'll never be a saint, no way
    My enemy
    Pray it away, I swear I'll never be a saint

    Sometimes, I can get a little
    I can get a little lonely
    Sometimes, I can get a little
    I can get a little lonely
    Some nights I get a little lonely
    It's even when there's people all around me
    Sometimes I get a little anxious
    'Cause these pills don't work the way the doctor played it
    I'm startin' to spin, needles and pins
    Right on the brim, hand on a limb, takin' it in
    Sleep it away, life in a day, and a day in a life
    Mixing it up, checkin' it twice
    Trying to breathe, starting to seize
    Lights, camera, action and scene
    Story of my life
    Oh, love (Sometimes, I can get a little)
    Have mercy (I can get a little lonely)
    On me (Sometimes, I can get a little)
    And keep me company (I can get a little lonely)

    I hide in corners, hope that no one sees me
    So I'm playin' a role, ridin' the boat, stuck in a hole
    Takin' a bow, lookin' so proud
    Look at me now, talkin' about pills in my mouth
    Under the tongue, isn't it fun?
    Trying to breathe, starting to seize
    Lights, camera, action and scene
    Story of my life, oh-oh
